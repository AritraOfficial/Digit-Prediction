# Digit-Prediction
## MNIST Digit Classification with Neural Network Using Deep Learning

This repository contains a deep learning project to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project leverages a neural network implemented using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in recognizing and classifying digits from 0 to 9.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes normalization and reshaping of the MNIST images.
Model Architecture: A neural network with multiple layers, including dense and dropout layers, to enhance model performance and prevent overfitting.
Training: The model is trained using a labeled dataset of 60,000 images.
Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on a test set of 10,000 images to measure its accuracy.
Visualization: Includes tools to visualize the loss and accuracy during training and sample predictions.

## Requirements
Python 3
TensorFlow or PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running and visualizing the notebooks)

## Results
We Achieved a high accuracy rate on the MNIST test dataset.
The model's performance is visualized through accuracy and loss plots.

### Contributing
